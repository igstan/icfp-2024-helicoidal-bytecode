# ICFP Contest 2024 â€” Helicoidal Bytecode

I've got the ICFP language interpreter done, including call-by-name and
call-by-value function application.

Solved a few of the "lambdaman" challenges in a very, VERY naive way.

Manually solved some of the "efficiency" problems by displaying the AST of the
ICFP language expressions in a quasi-Lisp syntax and manually reformatting it
to see the high-level program encoded in them, then either evaluating by hand
or manually translating to Haskell.

I haven't had any time to look into the "spaceship" or "3d" challenges.
